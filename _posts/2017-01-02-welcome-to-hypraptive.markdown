This is the first post for hypraptive. Hypraptive is a vessel for a couple of developers to get together and work on interesting projects and applications.

This site makes use of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We decided to go down this path after reading Andrej Karpathy's blog [Switching Blog from Wordpress to Jekyll](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/).
