excerpt: "An overview of the bear data we have from Brooks Falls."
---

So far we have put together a data set of approximately 1100 bear face chips, all from Brooks Falls bears. The face chips were extracted from photos from the following sources:

* [Mike Fitz's Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ikefitz/albums) (thanks Mike!)
* [Carla Farris' Flickr Album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/129908461@N03/albums/with/72157672138992512)
* [Ranger Jeanne's Flickr Album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeanner/albums)
* Photos sent by larinor (thank you!)

Below is a table of the Brooks Falls bear chip data. We have face chips for 43 different bears. The table has a row for each bear. The columns are:

* **ID**: the bear's identification number
* **Nickname**: the bear's nickname (if it has one)
* **Count**: the number of face chips we have for the bear
* **Example Face Images**: a few example face chips for the bear

ID | Nickname | Count | Example Face Images

# What We Need

As you can see, there are quite a few bears for which we only have a couple images. We really need more images of these bears to use them for training. We think we need at least 20 good face chips per bear, preferably from different seasons and different times of the season. We're hoping the set we get from Katmai will fill out our set, but we can always you more!

We are also not sure if we can use the images where the bear is looking far to the left or right or down. We're planning a few experiments to see how the various poses effect our results. If we have to filter out some of these more extreme poses, our dataset will get even smaller.

If you have decent quality photos or videos of the Brooks Falls bears, or of any other brown bears, please contact us at bearid [at] hypraptive [dot] com.

We are not using any captures from the [explore.org bearcams](http://explore.org/live-cams/player/brown-bear-salmon-cam-brooks-falls) at this time, as we don't think the quality is sufficient. Hopefully, once we have the application working reasonably well, we can adapt it to work with the bearcams as well!
