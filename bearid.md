This page provides an overview of [hypraptive's](/about/) open source [BearID Project](https://github.com/hypraptive/bearid), started in January of 2017. The goal of the project is to identify individual brown bears from photos and videos; face recognition technology for bears! The project resulted from the collision of two interests: [deep learning](/2017/01/03/deep-learning.html) and the [Brooks Falls bearcams](/2017/01/04/guilty-pleasures.html).

We started out by focusing on the [Bears of Brooks River](/2017/01/06/bears-of-brooks-river.html). We first needed to understand how the experts [identify individual bears](/2017/01/09/bear-necessities.html). Next, we reviewed some existing deep learning and computer vision projects aimed at [identifying animals in the wild](/2017/01/13/dl-in-the-wild.html). We decided on an initial approach based on [FaceNet, but for bears](/2017/01/21/facenet-for-bears.html). After trying different software packages and methods ([YOLO](/2017/01/29/find-the-bears-yolo.html), [dlib](/2017/02/02/find-the-bears-dlib.html), [HOG](/2017/02/03/bear-face-detector.html) and the [dog hipsterizer](/2017/02/08/hipster-bears.html)), we came out with [BearID 1.0](/2017/03/30/bearid-1-0.html).

It was a good start, but we still needed more data to improve accuracy.

# Brown Bear Research Network

<img align="right" src="/assets/BBRN.jpg">In April 2017, we joined the [WILDLABS.NET](https://www.wildlabs.net) community. Through an exchange of messages with the community manager, [Steph O'Donnell](https://www.wildlabs.net/users/stephodonnell), we learned about a researcher studying grizzly bears in British Columbia. Steph introduced us to [Melanie Clapham, Ph.D.](https://understandingbears.com/), founder and director of [The Brown Bear Research Network (BBRN)](http://bearresearch.org/).

The BBRN is a multi-disciplinary group made up of international biologists, naturalists and eco-tourism operators. Their mission is to fund and facilitate innovative and progressive research on brown (grizzly) bears in British Columbia. They had a similar idea for a software tool which can recognize individual brown bears from photos and camera trap footage.

Shortly after we were connected, hypraptive and the BBRN joined forces on the [BearID Project](https://github.com/hypraptive/bearid). We have the common goal of developing a new technology which can be used to assess and monitor populations, providing wildlife researchers with a new methodology to survey bears in the wild. Hypraptive provides the computer science and deep learning experience and the BBRN provides brown bear expertise and connections to the bear viewing community. As well as being a vital research tool, the ability to automatically and confidently recognize individual bears has huge potential for public engagement in bear conservation.

# We need YOUR HELP!

![Bear Face Chips](/assets/hipster-bears/images-front-chip.jpg){: figure }

Deep-learning methods require thousands of images to achieve the high accuracy of recognition required. We are looking for brown bear photographers, researchers, managers and enthusiasts to donate images and video footage to the project to enable us to improve the accuracy of our system. Supplied images and videos will be used for the sole purpose of training and testing the system.

Photos/videos can be of wild or captive brown bears, from anywhere in the world, provided they can be uniquely identified. Any resolution is ok as long as both eyes of the bear are clearly visible. A unique bear number/name should be in each file name or images of each bear can be grouped in folders (example: brooks0032). Please submit your images/footage or questions to <photos@bearresearch.org> (include a dropbox link or similar if required) or we can mail you a flash/hard drive.

Keep track of our progress via the [hypraptive blog](/). Follow the Brown Bear Research Network on twitter ([@bear_network](https://twitter.com/bear_network)) and Facebook ([@bearresearch](https://www.facebook.com/bearresearch/)).

Thank you in advance to the bear community for your help!
